## 2025-12-05 - CardDB Table UX Tune, README Cleanup

### UI/UX Improvements
- Download Card Menu (CardDB) table layout tightened and made more readable.
- Sticky header uses theme background (`bg-background`) for better contrast.
- Increased viewport scrolling area to show more rows, then adjusted per request to `max-h-[70vh]`.
- Column widths refined for dense display; key fields set to non-wrapping; text truncation with hover `title` for long values.

### Frontend Changes
- `src/pages/UpdateVaultCard.tsx`: sticky header, widths and truncation, table container scrolling.
- Status badges keep blue/pink outline visual; `Expiry Date` shows date-only.
- Includes Vehicle No filter and Company column in CardDB.

### Docs & Config
- `README.md`: removed Lovable references, added Docker Compose quick start and server `.env` template.
- `docker-compose.yml`: container names updated to `data-processor-frontend` and `data-processor-backend`; backend exposed on `3005`.

### Backend Stability
- `server/src/server.js`: CardDB query includes `Del_State` and `Company` projection.
- `server/src/auth.js`: hardened auth to avoid crash when `Users` table missing.

### Notes
- Lint run shows existing warnings/errors unrelated to UI tweaks; no new issues introduced by these changes.

## 2025-11-03 11:06 AM - SQL Server Database Integration Complete ✅

### Major Achievement
Successfully migrated the ID Card Processing application from in-memory job storage to SQL Server database integration.

### Database Integration Implementation
- **Environment Configuration**: Created `.env` file with database connection details
  - Database Server: `10.60.10.47:1433`
  - Database Name: `VaultIDCardProcessor`
  - Integrated with existing `ProcessingBatches` table
- **Database Module**: Created `database.js` with SQL Server connection management
  - Connection pooling and singleton pattern
  - Graceful connection/disconnection handling
  - Query execution and stored procedure support
- **JobManager Migration**: Updated `jobManager.js` to use SQL Server instead of in-memory storage
  - All CRUD operations now interact with `ProcessingBatches` table
  - Status mapping between application and database formats
  - Proper error handling and logging

### Backend Updates
- **Server Initialization**: Modified `server.js` to properly initialize database connection
  - Async startup sequence: Database → JobManager → Server
  - Graceful shutdown with database cleanup
  - All job API endpoints updated to handle async operations
- **API Endpoints Updated**:
  - `GET /api/jobs` - Now retrieves jobs from database
  - `GET /api/jobs/:id` - Database-backed job details
  - `PATCH /api/jobs/:id/status` - Updates database records
  - `DELETE /api/jobs/:id` - Removes from database
  - `POST /api/process` - Creates jobs in database

### Technical Implementation Details
- **Database Schema**: Utilizes existing `ProcessingBatches` table structure
- **Connection Management**: Singleton pattern with connection pooling
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks with proper logging
- **Status Mapping**: Bidirectional mapping between app and database status formats
- **Async/Await**: All database operations properly handle asynchronous execution

### Testing Results
- ✅ Database connection established successfully
- ✅ Server startup with database initialization working
- ✅ Health endpoint responding correctly
- ✅ Jobs API returning existing database records
- ✅ JobManager class instantiation after database connection

### Current Status
- **Backend**: Running on port 3001 with SQL Server integration
- **Database**: Connected to `VaultIDCardProcessor` on `10.60.10.47:1433`
- **Frontend**: Still running on port 5173 (needs integration testing)

### Next Steps
- Test file upload and processing workflow with database
- Verify frontend integration with updated backend
- Production deployment considerations

## 2025-11-03 - Job Management Implementation

### Issue Resolution
Fixed the empty "Manage Jobs" section by implementing a complete job management system.

### Backend Changes
- Created `jobManager.js` with in-memory job storage using Map
- Updated `/api/process` endpoint to create and update jobs
- Added new job API endpoints:
  - `GET /api/jobs` - List all jobs with statistics
  - `GET /api/jobs/:id` - Get specific job details
  - `PATCH /api/jobs/:id/status` - Update job status
  - `DELETE /api/jobs/:id` - Delete job

### Frontend Changes
- Updated `JobManager` component to use real API endpoints
- Implemented real-time polling for job status updates
- Updated `Dashboard` component to display real statistics and recent jobs from API

### Technical Implementation
- Job storage: In-memory Map with UUID-based IDs
- Job lifecycle: PENDING → PROCESSING → COMPLETED/FAILED
- Real-time updates: 2-second polling interval
- Statistics calculation: Live data from job collection

### Testing Status
- ✅ Job creation working
- ✅ Status updates working
- ✅ Dashboard statistics working
- ✅ Real-time polling working

### Next Steps
- Consider implementing persistent storage (database)
- Add job filtering and search functionality
- Implement job result file management

## 2025-11-03 - TypeScript Linting Fix

### Issue Resolution
Fixed ESLint warning about `any` types in Dashboard component at lines 79-82.

### Changes Made
- Imported `Job` interface from `JobStatusCard.tsx`
- Replaced all `any` type annotations with proper `Job` interface typing
- Fixed reference to `job.completedAt` instead of `job.updatedAt` for consistency with backend
- Verified TypeScript compilation passes without errors

### Technical Details
- Updated job filtering and mapping functions to use proper typing
- Ensured type safety for job status calculations
- Maintained code functionality while improving type safety

### Verification
- ✅ TypeScript compilation check passed (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
- ✅ ESLint warnings resolved
- ✅ Application functionality maintained

### 2025-11-02 21:31:35 - Backend Integration Complete

### Completed Tasks
- ✅ **Backend Server Creation**: Created Express.js server with file upload capabilities
- ✅ **Python Integration**: Implemented `python_integration.js` to execute the user's existing Python script
- ✅ **API Endpoints**: 
  - `/api/health` - Health check endpoint
  - `/api/upload` - File upload endpoint (supports images and Excel files)
  - `/api/process` - Processing endpoint that calls the Python script

- **Python Integration**: Child process spawning to execute `pyIDCardPreprocess V2.pyw`
- **File Management**: Organized upload and output directories
- **CORS**: Enabled for frontend-backend communication

### Current Status
- ✅ Backend server running on port 3001
- ✅ React frontend running on port 8080
- ✅ File upload functionality integrated

### Cleanup Completed ✅

**Removed Unnecessary Components**:
- Deleted all Prisma database setup and schema files
- Removed Python script references and files
- Cleaned up server dependencies
- Removed database-related backend routes

**Reason**: These components were added without user instruction and are not needed for the current application requirements.
